I work on panel data econometrics with my supervisors, [Eric Renault](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/emrrenault/) and [Kenichi Nagasawa](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/knagasawa/).
### Granular Instrumental Variables
The methodology of Granular Instrumental Variables (GIV) pioneered by Gabaix and Koijen (2022) offers an exciting way to estimate structural parameters on endogenous variables. I am pursuing methodological research on this. Currently I am working on two projects:

#### Theory for Panels with Finite Cross Sectional Units (with Kenichi Nagasawa)
I research on extending the theory of Granular Instrumental Variables (GIV) for panels with finite cross-sectional units and infinite time dynamics when both common factors and factor loadings in the error term are not available. 

#### Optimal and Weak GIV (with Eric Renault)
I research on the construction of optimal GIV and advanced inferential issues like weak instruments when the economy is not sufficinetly granular.
